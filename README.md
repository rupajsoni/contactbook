# Employment directory
A directory to store and display employment details for individuals. It is a demo app to understand the MEAN architecture.

## Technologies used:
MongoDB - NoSQL database to store and retrieve the employment details

Express - Web application framework for Node.js

Angular.js - Front end Javascript which enables dynamic web content, two way data binding and modular coding

Node.js - Server side Javascript exposing APIs

## Instructions on how to run this project:
Assuming you have already installed the required softwares to run Node.js, MongoDB and Angular, follow these steps to deploy the application on your localhost:
1. Clone this repository
2. Start MongoDB
3. Load Node dependencies `<repository-path> > npm install`
4. Start Node server `<repository-path> > node app.js` Thiss will start your server on localhost:3000 which exposes an API to send and retrive contacts data.
5. Start Angular client `<repository-path>\client > npm start` This will run the client web UI on localhost:4200 which interacts with the Node application.
